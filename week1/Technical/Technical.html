    <h2 id="h1">What is C++?</h2>
    <ul>
          <li>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

        </li>
        <li>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

        </li>
         <li>C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

        </li>
        <li>The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.

        </li>

    </ul>
    <h2 id="h2">Why Use C++?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

        </li>
        <li>
            C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.


        </li>
        <li>
            C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.


        </li>
        <li>
            C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.


        </li>
        <li>
            C++ is fun and easy to learn!


        </li>
        <li>
            As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.


        </li>
    </ul>
        <h2 id="h3">Difference between C and C++</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.

            </li>
            <li>The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.

            </li>




        </ul>
